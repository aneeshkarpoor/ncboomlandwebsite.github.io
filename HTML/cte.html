                        <p class="blog-single-topic">Being a STEM-based school, North Creek High School has one of the most diverse STEM course offerings in the region. When paired with a team of teachers with over 50 years in industry experience, the North Creek CTE Program offers a learning experience unlike any other.</p>

                        <center><p class="blog-single-topic"><br><u>CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION LEAD TEACHERS</u></p></center>
                        <center><p><b>JEFF STRIDE (COMPUTER SCIENCE & MATHEMATICS): </b>Jeff Stride grew up in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. He attended Cupertino High School, which is just a few blocks from the home base of Apple. His first computer was an Apple II+, and he proudly displays this very same machine in my classroom today, completely functional! He interned at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View for several years, where he did FORTRAN programming to graph Blackhawk helicopter airfoil data in 3D and learned in a very painstaking way how to do technical writing. He has a diverse college experience, having first attended a community college, then Brown University, then San Jose State University, and finally UC Santa Barbara.
   He has wanted to be a teacher since he was in high school; he tutored math for many years and volunteered in various classrooms. When he completed his bachelor's degree, he nearly started his teaching certification process then. But, the allure of studying Computer Science alongside the beaches of Santa Barbara was the winner. Microsoft brought him to the northwest and provided a career for him. Now, he teaches Introduction to Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, and will teach Advanced Programming Topics 1 & 2 starting next year at North Creek High School.</p></center>

                         <center><p><b>BILL ROSENTHAL (DIGITAL MEDIA): </b>Bill Rosenthal has been teaching in Northshore School District for about ten years. He was at North Creek last year and the previous nine were spent at Skyview Junior High (now a middle school). Prior to teaching he spent 28 years as an Art Director in San Francisco. His first job out of art school was using clay to create design prototypes for the Jawa Sandcrawler in what we thought would be a little movie: Star Wars: A New Hope. Prior to art school I was a combat photographer in the U.S. Navy. I was born in Minnesota but spent my entire youth living in Compton, California. Classes taught: Digital Photography, Advanced Digital Photography, Graphic Design, Advanced Graphic Design, Yearbook. Education background: BFA, Sculpture. San Francisco Art Institute; MBA, Marketing. Golden Gate University.; Teacher education. UW Bothell; Art Endorsement. Seattle U.; WA State Professional Teaching Certificate</p></center>

                         <center><p><b>DOUG HAKALA (ENGINEERING & AERONAUTICS): </b>Doug Hakala’s programs at North Creek and Bothell High represent terrific opportunities to help young men and women as they explore and gain confidence in their futures in business, marketing, and technology. At Bothell, he teaches the core “Intro to Marketing” course, and specialty courses in computer applications, fashion marketing, retail operations, robotics, and also sports & entertainment marketing. At North Creek, he currently teaches Aviation and Website Design.
He has many years of industry experience as a marketing, sales and R&D professional. He brings a solid history of developing products, markets and partnerships at companies such as Boeing, Medtronic and Weyerhaeuser into the classroom. For example, he has been involved in developing, marketing and selling life-saving medical devices such as AEDs (automated external defibrillators) domestically, and also internationally, in countries such as China. Education background: Masters in Engineering, Masters in Business Administration, Certified CTE Instructor in Business and STEM.</p></center>
