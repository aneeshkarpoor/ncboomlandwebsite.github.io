                        Prerequisite: Completion of Algebra 1 or instructor permission</br>
                        Diploma Category: O</br>
                        This introductory course offers students who are comfortable with math a hands-on approach to building creative projects and learning about the science of computers that surrounds us every day. The course is far more than just a fun, collaborative environment for learning to program graphical and engaging games in Snap! It introduces students to algorithms, procedural decomposition, abstraction, object oriented design, concurrency, agile development methodologies, refactoring and optimization.

                        Prerequisite: Completion of Geometry or instructor permission</br>
                        Diploma Category: O</br>
                        In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of computing – including problem solving, working with data, understanding the internet, cybersecurity, and programming. Students completing this course should leave with a broadened understanding of computer science for use in diverse majors and careers. Those wanting to earn AP credit will submit two “through-course performance tasks” to the College Board for grading, and will take a multiple-choice end-of-year exam. This course is not a prerequisite for AP Computer Science A, but AP Computer Science A is the logical follow-up class for students inspired to study computer science more deeply after completing this class.

                        <center><p><b>AP COMPUTER SCIENCE A: </b></br>Length/Credit: One semester/.5 credit
                        Grades: 10, 11, 12</br>
                        Prerequisite: Completion AP CS A or Equivalent</br>
                        Diploma Category: O</br>
                        This course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer science by teaching Java, an object oriented programming language.  No prior programming experience is necessary to enroll, but the course is fast-paced and meant to replicate a college introductory programming class (CSE 142 at the UW). Students are challenged to solve difficult problems and to develop multiple class projects. Students will learn topics that include procedural programming (methods, parameters, return values), basic control structures (sequence, if/else, loops), file processing, collections, object-oriented design, and recursion. This course prepares students to take the AP CS A Exam in May .

                        Diploma Category: O</br>
                        This course provides an opportunity for highly motivated students who have completed a yearlong college-level Computer Science course (Computer Science with C#.NET, AP Computer Science A) to continue their studies in this field. In this course you will learn about advanced data structures and algorithms, while expanding your knowledge of object-oriented programming. As the year progresses each student will be given increased flexibility to focus more deeply on the topics and technologies that catch and hold their interest.

                        This course is designed to give students the opportunity to explore the world of robotics through the basic principles of design, construction, and programming of robots while learning problem-solving techniques, mathematics, logic, creativity, physics, electronics, mechanics, teamwork, computers and computer programming. The class is structured for both technical and non-technical students. Students will first learn how the basic components of a robot operate and then learn to join them together to form a robot that can complete simple functions. Students will use VEX Robot kits to design, build, test and modify their own robots. In the labs, students either individually or as teams will be challenged to construct robots that will perform a series of tasks. The goal of the class is to provide students the opportunity to apply science, math, technology, and engineering skills and concepts to something which is both challenging and fun.
